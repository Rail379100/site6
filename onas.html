                INTRODUCTION BY THE FOUNDER
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                My name is Monica Perez and I was born in the city of Zaragoza, in the north-east of Spain. In Zaragoza I studied economics at the university and at the same time completed my music studies at the Teruel Conservatory with a specialization in piano.
                <br><br>
                During this time I was always connected to associations for young people, in which I worked as a catechist, animator and group leader and took part in social activities with street children, gypsies, senior citizens, prisoners, etc.

            <p>
                It was my professional goal early on to support people in difficult life situations and to work to improve their living conditions.
                <br><br>
                That is why I specialized in international cooperation and humanitarian aid and completed a master’s degree at the Universidad de Comillas in Madrid. After completing my studies, I worked for the Spanish Embassy and Caritas Española, among others.
                <br><br>
                This job has given me the opportunity to travel to many different countries and gain experience in these cultures, especially in Latin America and Asia.
                <br><br>
                I moved to Switzerland at the age of 35. This is where my two sons were born. Becoming a mother was a turning point in my professional life. I had to reinvent myself to reconcile work and motherhood
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="ban2" class="baner_text">
            <p>
                That's why I started working as a Spanish teacher for adults in “Spanish Studio” in Lucerne. Based on my extensive experience as a mother in a bilingual environment and with family integration as a goal, I developed “Spanish for Children”.
                <br><br>
                In February 2019 I completed the training as “playgroup leader” at IG Bildung in Lucerne and I am continuing to learn about the theory and practice of child pedagogy. In 2020 I completed the children's teacher course for ELE (Español como Lengua Extranjera) from ELE Intenational and Universidad Europea Miguel de Cervantes.
                <br><br>
                At the moment I am continuing my education by taking various courses with a focus on pedagogy.

                In my life I have learned different languages because of needs and coincidences. With Spanish as my mother tongue, I learned French at school, needed English for my work, German for my family life and Swiss German for my integration in Switzerland.
                <br><br>
                This experience has shown me that promoting languages in childhood is very beneficial. It is particularly useful for children with a social or family connection to a foreign language. If it is Spanish for you ... I am very happy to assist you.

                I am Mexican and have lived in Switzerland for 5 years. I have a Masters degree in Foreign Language Teaching from the Antonio Betancourt Institute in the State of Yucatán, am a graduate of Total Tourist Technology University of Modern Languages. I have 13 years of teaching experience working with both children and adults.
                <br><br>
                Before I came to Switzerland, I worked in a private and bilingual school for 6 years. There I was not only a teacher but also a teacher coordinator. This enabled me to see education as one big family: the student, the teacher, the parents and the institution.
                <br><br>
                I am currently working as a Spanish teacher at the Migros Club School, and I also look after children. I am happy that I am part of Spanish for Children.
                <br><br>
                In a nutshell ... teaching is my passion!

                My name is Noelia Morell and I come from Elche (Alicante), a city in the southeast of Spain.

                I am a child teacher and a specialist in children with special educational needs.
                I am also the founder of the Educagreens educational project to create healthy schools around the world.
                <br><br>
                For me, education means giving children wings so they can fly until they reach their dreams. They are capable of ANYTHING if we give them the tools to achieve it.
